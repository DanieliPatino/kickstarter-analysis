# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Finding trends of exhisting kickstarters to provide information on the best way to run a successful kickstarter campaign for plays.

### Purpose
Assisting Louise on her kickstarter campaign for her play by providing trendes and charts.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
- After filtering the data so it only shows the successful theather campaingns, we can see the best months for a kickstarter is in the summer months, May and June. 
- Please see the following chart:

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
- After filtering the data to show the outcomes of the kickstarter plays based on the amount of previous campaign goals, we can see that in order to have a successful play campaign Louise needs to ask for a goal raging in the 1000 to 5000.  
- Please see the following chart:

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
- Due to the multiple categories and different countries the initial starter book had, we had to filter the inforamtion depending on what Louise was requesting. Some of the challenges I encounter was making sure I was filtering the proper information and using the correct functions so the updated information was presented clearly.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1) Most successful time of the year is the summer. 2) Not a lot of cancelled outcomes for theater kickstarters.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
  - If a kickstarter is asking for too much money, 45000 or higher, it has the highest chance of failing. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
  - It does not provide us a date range to see if the cancelled or failed were preventable due to the season of year.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
  - We can create a new table or graph to show the economic class and location of where the kickstarter is located. Depending on the location it can make a difference on how much a community can or is willing to donate.
